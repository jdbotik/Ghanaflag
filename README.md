<h2>Description</h2>
This was a fun project I did to create an image of a wavy flag for my country on the day they played in the world cup.
The Ghana Flag Visualization project is a Python program I developed to celebrate Ghana's participation in the World Cup. Inspired by their match, I decided to create a flag representation using the Turtle graphics library. The project involved initially creating a static version of the Ghana flag and then enhancing it by adding a wave effect to make it visually dynamic.

<h2>Key Feature</h2>
Dynamic Wave Effect: After creating the static flag, I implemented a wave effect to make the flag appear as if it is waving in the wind, adding a sense of movement and realism to the visualization.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>
- <b>Turtle, Python</b> 
- <b>Pydroid</b>


<h2>Environments Used </h2>
- <b>Android phone</b> 

<h2>Challenges</h2>
- <b>The main challenge was creating the waving effect, it took a lot of trial and errors for it to finally work. Some several hours</b>

<h2>Future Improvements:</h2>
- While the current version of the Ghana flag visualization is visually appealing, there are opportunities for further enhancements.
- Potential improvements could include adding interactivity, such as allowing users to control the speed and intensity of the waving effect, or incorporating additional visual elements related to the World Cup or Ghanaian culture.
